# Looking at Chinese Remainder Theorem...
# Taken
#         x = a1 (mod n1)
#         x = a2 (mod n2)
#         x = a3 (mod n3)
# With gcd(n1,n2) = gcd(n1,n3) = gcd(n2,n3) = 1
#         -All the n-values are coprime with the others
# We have N = n1*n2*n3 and
#         N1 = n2*n3
#         N2 = n1*n3
#         N3 = n1*n2
# Summaring, the Ni values are composed multiplying all
# the n-values each others, except n at position i
# Ending, we call yi the solutions of Ni*yi = 1 (mod ni)
#         Ex: N1 * y1 = 1 (mod n1)
# Now, we have to find the value of integer a such that:
#         x = a (mod N)
# Knowing also that:
#         x = a1N1y1 + a2N2y2 + a3N3y3 (mod N)
# Easy, no?
# '''
# x = 2 mod 5
# x = 3 mod 11
# x = 5 mod 17

# x = a mod 935
